**Editor’s Note:** *As domestic competition reaches a saturation point, BYD's performance in 2025 has become a bellwether for the Chinese EV industry’s global ambitions. Our analysts have synthesized the latest customs and insurance registration data to map this pivot.*

## The Great Rebalance: From Shenzhen to the World

In 2025, the defining narrative for **BYD** was no longer just its domestic dominance, but its aggressive **"Global Pivot."** While the price war in China intensified, BYD’s overseas strategy shifted from "testing the waters" to "systemic expansion."

According to our field observations and retail data, the share of export volume relative to total production has seen a tectonic shift. In early 2024, exports accounted for roughly **8-10%** of total sales; by late 2025, this figure surged toward the **20%** threshold.

### 1. Key Performance Metrics (2024-2025)

The following table illustrates the strategic reweighting of BYD's sales portfolio. The growth in overseas markets is not merely incremental—it is foundational to the brand's margin preservation.


| Period | Domestic Sales (Est.) | Export Volume (Est.) | Export Share (%) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Q1 2024** | 560,000 | 63,000 | 10.1% |
| **Q3 2024** | 780,000 | 95,000 | 10.8% |
| **Q1 2025** | 620,000 | 135,000 | 17.8% |
| **Q4 2025 (Projected)** | 850,000 | 210,000 | **19.8%** |

### 2. Regional Growth Engines
Our intelligence suggests that BYD’s growth is concentrated in three "High-Yield" corridors:

- **The ASEAN Corridor:** Thailand and Indonesia have become BYD's "second home markets," where the **Atto 3** and **Dolphin** maintain a top-3 market share in the EV segment.
- **The Latin American Surge:** Brazil has emerged as a critical hub, especially with the localized production plans in Bahia, providing a buffer against potential trade barriers.
- **The EU "Gateway":** Despite ongoing anti-subsidy investigations, BYD's strategic partnerships in Hungary and Turkey are positioning the brand as a "local European player" rather than a pure importer.

### 3. Supply Chain Mastery: The "Ro-Ro" Advantage
A critical factor in this data surge is BYD’s investment in its own logistics. In 2025, the deployment of the **"BYD Explorer No. 1"** and subsequent Ro-Ro (Roll-on/Roll-off) vessels significantly reduced the "Logistics Tax" that previously hampered export margins. 

> "By controlling the fleet, BYD has decoupled its export capacity from the volatile global shipping market, a luxury few other homegrown brands can afford." — *AutoChina Intelligence Analyst*

### 4. Sentiment Analysis: Premium Positioning Overseas
Interestingly, the data shows a **"Price Premium"** for BYD models sold abroad. A Han EV in Europe or the UAE often commands a price 1.5x to 2x higher than its domestic MSRP. This suggests that while BYD fights a "Price War" at home, it is building a "Value Brand" image internationally.

---

### Analyst's View: The 2026 Outlook
We project that by the end of 2026, BYD’s export contribution could exceed **25%**. However, the primary risk remains **geopolitical friction**. The transition from "Exporting Vehicles" to "Local Manufacturing" (Glocalization) will be the next critical metric we track.
