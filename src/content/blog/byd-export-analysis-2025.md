**Editor’s Note:** *As domestic competition reaches a saturation point, BYD's performance in 2025 has become a bellwether for the Chinese EV industry’s global ambitions. Our analysts have synthesized the latest data to map this pivot.*

## The Great Rebalance: From Shenzhen to the World

In 2025, the defining narrative for **BYD** was no longer just its domestic dominance, but its aggressive **"Global Pivot."** While the price war in China intensified, BYD’s overseas strategy shifted from "testing the waters" to "systemic expansion."

### 1. Key Performance Metrics (2024-2025)

The growth in overseas markets is not merely incremental—it is foundational to the brand's margin preservation.


| Period | Domestic Sales (Est.) | Export Volume (Est.) | Export Share (%) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Q1 2024** | 560,000 | 63,000 | 10.1% |
| **Q1 2025** | 620,000 | 135,000 | 17.8% |
| **Q4 2025 (Proj)** | 850,000 | 210,000 | **19.8%** |

### 2. Supply Chain Mastery: The "Ro-Ro" Advantage
A critical factor in this surge is BYD’s investment in its own logistics. In 2025, the deployment of the **"BYD Explorer No. 1"** and subsequent Ro-Ro vessels significantly reduced the "Logistics Tax" that previously hampered export margins.

### 3. Intelligence Alert: The Geopolitical Friction
While the volume growth is undeniable, our intelligence suggests that BYD’s **"Juggernaut Expansion"** is hitting an invisible wall of trade protectionism.

- **Market Disruption:** The influx of high-quality, low-cost BYD models is no longer seen just as competition; it is perceived as a disruption to local industrial ecosystems in Europe and North America.
- **The "Trade Aggression" Narrative:** Our analysts warn that this **unprecedented industrial pressure** could trigger systemic geopolitical friction. If BYD's localized production (Glocalization) cannot offset the perceived threat to local employment, we expect a heightened frequency of anti-dumping probes and unconventional trade barriers in late 2026.

***

**Analyst's View:** *BYD's biggest challenge in 2026 isn't engineering—it's diplomacy. Winning market share is one thing; maintaining it in a fragmented geopolitical landscape is another.*
